    shortDesc:
      "A comprehensive e-commerce solution with advanced features like cart management, user authentication, and payment integration.",
    detailedDesc: `Building an end-to-end e-commerce system has been a passion project of mine. Using the **MERN stack**, I developed a comprehensive solution with a few key integrations.

**MongoDB** was my go-to for handling user data and orders, while I leveraged **PostgreSQL with Strapi** to manage the product catalog. The backend is powered by **Node.js with Express**, and the frontend is built with **React, RTK, and Material UI**, creating a responsive and intuitive user experience.

For deployment, I used **Railway** for the backend and **Hostinger** for the frontend. To manage product images efficiently, I integrated **Cloudinary**.

Since this is a side hustle, I opted for free services to keep costs low. My goal was to create a robust foundation for a new business venture. While I've been actively working on the business side, including supply chain and marketing, I've spent more time on the technical developmentâ€”because that's what I truly love to do.`,

    detailedDesc: `Travel India Explorer was born from my love for exploring the diverse beauty of India. I wanted to create a platform that not only showcases incredible destinations but also helps fellow travelers plan their next adventure.

Built with **React** and powered by **Firebase**, this application features a clean, intuitive interface that makes discovering new places effortless. I implemented **custom hooks** for state management and data fetching, ensuring smooth performance across all interactions.

The styling is crafted with **Tailwind CSS**, providing a modern, responsive design that adapts beautifully to any screen size. Users can explore destinations through an interactive map, read detailed descriptions, and save their favorite spots for future reference.

What makes this project special is the **real-time database integration** with Firebase, allowing users to contribute their own travel experiences and recommendations, creating a community-driven travel resource.`,

    detailedDesc: `Vallys Bliss was my first major freelance project, creating a stunning web presence for a premium event management company. The client wanted something that would reflect the elegance and professionalism of their high-end events.

I crafted this project using **React** with a focus on creating smooth, engaging animations that tell the company's story. **Framer Motion** powers the beautiful transitions and scroll-triggered animations, while **react-scroll** ensures seamless navigation between sections.

The design emphasizes visual storytelling, with carefully orchestrated animations that guide users through the company's services, portfolio, and testimonials. Every interaction is purposeful, creating an immersive experience that reflects the quality of events they create.
